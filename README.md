# Aphex Twin Wallpapers — Gallery

AFXWALLS is a small, unofficial static gallery collecting wallpapers inspired by Aphex Twin artwork. The site showcases images shared by community contributors and is intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Wallpapers are provided as external/shared links rather than hosted directly on this site.

If you are the owner of any image featured here and would like it removed, please contact the site maintainer at `studio.bytelowergames@gmail.com`.

Contributing
 - To suggest or add a wallpaper, email your submission to the address above.

Planned improvements
 - Make the site dynamic (server-backed hosting)
 - Allow direct uploads so contributors can add wallpapers through the web interface
 - Provide a lightweight online editor with templates and a vector logo for quick edits and exports
 - Preserve anonymity: no account system or forum; the gallery will remain open and anonymous by design
